== Connect the Dots

Connect the Dots is a teacher created resource to help new teachers find answers to the questions they have.

This is the prototype, which was built in 3 hours during [Startup Weekend EDU SF](http://sfedu.startupweekend.org/)

Richard Lee did all of the design, and @pingram did all of the development.
